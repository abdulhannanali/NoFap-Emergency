##For [Reddit's r/NoFap](http://reddit.com/r/NoFap)
[NoFap Emergency](http://nofapemergency.com) is to get you to the right content when you need it. 
There's also a [bookmarklet (drag to your bookmarks bar)](http://emergency.nofap.org/director.php?cat=bookmarklet) that goes straight to emergency.

Here's the [initial Reddit discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2fvyhb/thank_you_for_the_relapse_prevention_tool/) and then one that got [much bigger.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2g05rx/i_just_noticed_this_but_holy_shit_the_new_relapse/) [Edit: one more,](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2grt82/emergency_nofap_tool_rocks/) [and the official forum](http://www.nofap.org/forum/showthread.php?21180-NoFap-s-Emergency-Relapse-Prevention-Tool)
