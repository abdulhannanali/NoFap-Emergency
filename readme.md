There's also a [bookmarklet](http://emergency.nofap.org/director.php?cat=bookmarklet) (drag to your bookmarks bar) that goes straight to emergency.

Here's the [initial](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2fvyhb/thank_you_for_the_relapse_prevention_tool/) Reddit discussion and then one that got [much bigger.](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2g05rx/i_just_noticed_this_but_holy_shit_the_new_relapse/)
Also [one more,](http://www.reddit.com/r/NoFap/comments/2grt82/emergency_nofap_tool_rocks/) and [the official forum](http://www.nofap.org/forum/showthread.php?21180-NoFap-s-Emergency-Relapse-Prevention-Tool)
